duti
====

duti is a command-line utility capable of setting default applications for
various document types on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), using Apple's
[Uniform Type
Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/understanding_utis/understand_utis_intro/understand_utis_intro.html)
(UTI). A UTI is a unique string describing the format of a file's content. For
instance, a Microsoft Word document has a UTI of `com.microsoft.word.doc`. Using
`duti`, the user can change which application acts as the default handler for a
given UTI.


Compiling
---------

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


Usage
-----

`duti` can read settings from four different sources:

1. standard input

1. a settings file

1. an XML [property list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list) (plist)

1. command-line arguments.

A settings line, as read in cases 1 and 2, consists of an application's bundle
ID, a UTI, and a string describing what role the application handles for the
given UTI. The process is similar when `duti` processes a plist. If the path
given to `duti` on the command-line is a directory, `duti` will apply settings
from all valid settings files in that directory, excluding files whose names
begin with `.` (single dot).

`duti` can also print out the default application information for a given
extension (`-x`). This feature is based on public domain source code posted
by Keith Alperin on the heliumfoot.com blog.

See the man page for additional usage details.


Examples
--------

* Set Safari as the default handler for HTML documents:

    ```sh
    duti -s com.apple.Safari public.html all
    ```

* Set TextEdit as the default handler for Word documents:

    ```sh
    echo 'com.apple.TextEdit   com.microsoft.word.doc all' | duti
    ```

* Set Finder as the default handler for ftp:// URLs:

    ```sh
    duti -s com.apple.Finder ftp
    ```

* Get default application information for .jpg files:

    ```sh
    duti -x jpg

    # Output
    Preview
    /Applications/Preview.app
    com.apple.Preview
    ```

Support
-------

`duti` is unsupported. You can submit bug reports and feature requests at
the duti [GitHub project page](https://github.com/moretension).

You can refer to [dutis](https://github.com/tsonglew/dutis) for a more
actively maintained tool, it's a wrapper around duti, providing an
interactive interface toselect default applications.
